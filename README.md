# bone-fracture-detection-
Analysing the dataset from Kaggle and implementing image processing by pre-processing the data, image segmentation, feature extraction, and feature detection to increase the accuracy to detect bone fracture by 84%.

### Note:
Manual folder contains temporary work which detects the location of fracture in a given x-ray image manually(not totally, tho;)

### How to run:
* Head to the root folder: `cd Bone-Fracture-Detection`
* Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Head to the `manual` folder: `cd manual`
* Run `main.py`: `python main.py`

###
If you want to test on different images, alter the corresponding variables inside `main.py`
